The returned indicators include:

**Trend Indicators:**
* `ema`: Exponential Moving Average, used to assess short- to mid-term trend; reacts quickly but may be affected by noise in choppy markets.
* `supertrend`: Trend-following indicator that clearly defines bullish/bearish switching, ideal for swing entries in trending markets.
* `ichimoku`: A multi-dimensional trend tool that includes support/resistance and trend consensus zones.
* `donchianchannels`: High-low breakout bands used to detect trend initiation points.

**Momentum Indicators:**
* `macd`: Dual moving average momentum indicator; useful for identifying trend initiation and divergence signals.
* `rsi`: Detects overbought/oversold conditions; helps identify pullbacks and rebounds in swing trades.
* `stochrsi`: A more sensitive version of RSI, ideal for identifying short-term swing highs and lows.
* `stc`: Schaff Trend Cycle, a fast-reacting trend cycle detector, quicker than MACD.
* `trix`: Smoothed momentum oscillator that filters out minor price fluctuations in ranging markets.
* `vwap`: Volume Weighted Average Price, measures the current price relative to the cost basis zone.

**Volatility Indicators:**
* `atr`: Average True Range, measures volatility and helps set stop-loss/take-profit levels.
* `bbands`: Bollinger Bands, used to detect extreme price deviations and identify reversal or breakout zones.
* `keltnerchannels`: Volatility channel based on ATR, useful for identifying pullback entries in trends.
* `chop`: Choppiness Index, indicates whether the market is trending or ranging, useful for strategy selection.

**Structure Indicators** (Return value explanation: `0` means no pattern found on the last candle; `100` means the pattern is found; `-100` indicates the reverse trend of the pattern is found):
* `engulfing`: Engulfing pattern, a strong trend reversal signal commonly found at swing turning points.
* `hammer`: Hammer candle with a long lower shadow, a bullish bottom signal useful for confirming dip entries.
* `morningstar`: Morning Star, a three-candle bullish reversal pattern, suitable for mid-term swing entry.
* `eveningstar`: Evening Star, a bearish reversal formation signaling potential swing tops or exit points.
* `3whitesoldiers`: Three White Soldiers, a bullish continuation pattern often used for trend confirmation and adding to positions.
* `3blackcrows`: Three Black Crows, a bearish reversal pattern, suitable for exiting at the top of an uptrend.
